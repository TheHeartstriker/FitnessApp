I like fitness excersies daily and I saw that there was a lot of fitness trackers and the like. They do things along the line of tracking sets and or diet and
while thats great on the surface I found that tracking sets can be easily tracked in notepad along with a diet. I dont know if others ever felt the same but it
kind of felt like a was of time. Altough its a little hard to track diets daily and
doing it in a closed of ecosystem in the form of an app loses its purpose of tracking everything perciesally. So I wanted to make something that I would actaully use
and benift from and maybe others would to.

Description and usage
This app tracks a few simple metrics time, effort, weight and heartrate. It was meant to give a look at the overall progress without wasting your time.
It tracks things like how much time you have spent in spefic zones overall over a period of time how many calories have you burned in that time. Average heart
rate average weight ecetra. I find it nice to zoom out a bit and look at the total effort you have put in thats mainly what this app is a zoomed out look at what you or others with the share
feature have done in a period of time.
