export const sharingText = `While simple as of writing this, FGraphs allows you to share your fitness data with other users! 
It's just a page where certain data points can be shown to others based on your username.`;

Such as resting heart rate, weight, and time spent in workout zones.`;

Not so much because there is not much to say! But I need to fill space for a good design. So here we are...`;

export const creativeText = `This site was built with creativity in mind! To evolve my design skills and build something unique. As such hopefully as I continue to update FGraphs, it will become a more and more creative experience! With fun micro interactions and full-on simulations and weird experiences for you to explore. Currently 
it's a little simple, because I am focusing on my core design skills, but in the future this application will be a playground for my creativity while still being functional!`;

export const supportText = `FGraphs will be constantly updated with new features, bug fixes, and improvements! As I improve as a developer, and find time this will be updated. It's less a passion project, and more a way for me to improve and prove my skills as a dev. Something to show off what I can do! 
As such I will be constantly updating this app with new features and improvements! Until it has either lived its life cycle, or I get bored of it!`;
